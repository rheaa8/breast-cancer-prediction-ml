# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the complete ML workflow starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Overview
Early detection of breast cancer is critical in healthcare. This project uses a supervised learning approach to analyze medical diagnostic data and make accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## Workflow
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection  
- Model training  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## Model
The project applies machine learning algorithms to classify tumors as malignant or benign and evaluates performance using standard classification metrics.

## Results
The trained model achieves reliable performance, showing how machine learning can assist in medical decision-making and early diagnosis.

## How to Run
